							<h1>Why I would be a <br /> good community manager</h1>

							<blockquote>
								<p>1. I learned hospitality early on from my dad.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>Growing up my dad ran church retreat centers. That's where he taught me that customer service means doing whatever needs to be done, even if it was never written down in a job description. For him this often meant digging people's cars out of the snow (at a retreat center in the mountains of Colorado). <br /><br /> Being community manager means being available and happy to serve in a wide variety of ways.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>2. I Loved Dorm Life</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>I loved living in the dorm in college because of the opportunity to interact with a very immediate community. One of the best memories was from that time was when we instituted a community meal plan that eventually had about 30 members. There was a rotation of 9 apartments that would provide dinner for everyone. The rotation had us eating together 3 nights a week. It was a highlight of my college experience. <br /><br />As community manager I would similarly be active in fostering friendships in the building.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>3. I have pastoral experience</p></blockquote>
							<p>After college I spent a year working as a pastor. The thing that attracted me to pastoring was fostering community. My job was love people by understanding what was important in their lives, to let them know we missed them at church, and to visit their elderly family members.  <br /><br />Connecting with people, listening to them, and solving problems has always come naturally for me.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>4. I facilitate community through storytelling</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>I created a storytelling organization called Another Story where I learned that storytelling is a very powerful force for building community. A great way to connect people together is to encourage them to share some of their most memorable moments.<br /><br />As community manager, I would facilitate storytelling events as a part of the rhythm of community life.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>5. I demonstrated helpfulness during the Innovation Delegation</p></blockquote>
							<p>Last October WayPaver hosted 10 innovative people for a week. I spent that week chasing down anything that could make their experience more enjoyable. Each delegate had different things they wanted to get out of the experience, and they we're impressed with my eagerness to meet a wide range of requests. <br /><br />Being community manager requires patience and willingness to accomodate individual needs.</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>I'm made for this job.</p></blockquote>
							<p>In summary, I'm intrinsically motivated by hospitality and making connections. It's a job that doesn't feel like work. I'd love to talk more about this opportunity.</p>
